# 2D Schrodinger equation
The final project for the Physics Numerical Methods class focused on the implementation of solving second-order partial differential equations using the Cranck-Nicolson algorithm on the example of 2D Schrodinger. 

Configuration allows for simulation on a 2D grid with fixed boundary conditions. The process of graphing is implemented using the Python matplotlib library, at the moment I use .csv tables for transferring data from the C++ part to Python.
