# 2D Schrodinger equation
Final project for Physics Numerical Methods class focused on implementaiton of solving second order partial differential equations using the Cranck-Nicolson algorythm on the example of 2D Scrodinger. 

Configuration allows for simulation on a 2D grid with fixed boundary conditions. Process of graphing is implemented using Python matplotlib library, at the moment I use .csv tables for transfer data from C++ part to Python.
